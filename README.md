# Network RGB
This is an in progress project to create a functioning networked rgb light controller.
# Why?
I previously had made a project with nodejs to control lights, but it had problems with lag on the low powered hardware of a raspberry pi 0. This is why I had to switch to a compiled language, and since I'm not that familiar with rust I thought this would be a good first project. Also, my old pi had its data corrupted so I lost much of the source code as I hadn't pushed many of the changes.
